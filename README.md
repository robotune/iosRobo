# iosRobo

RoboTune is an iOS application that uses the open source CSound library https://github.com/csound/csound (although it is probably a few versions behind) to show what is possible with the mobile version of this library.

The application itself is somewhat mature although written by an objective-c novice (C# background). The application has 2 co-authors with Dr. Brian Carty focusing on CSD for the CSound engine and Alan O'Sullivan integrating this with the CSound iOS libraries and general UI of the application.

There are numerous other libraries utilised in this application which will be listed in due course.
